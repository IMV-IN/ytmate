# Rules
1. Understand the code first, its not very tough just read through it, even basic understanding of python will do.
2. Keep the documentation of the following Python packages in hand:
   
    - [Pytube](pypi.org/project/pytube/): [Docs](pytube.io/en/latest/)
    - [Moviepy](pypi.org/project/moviepy/): [Docs](moviepy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#)
    - tkinter: [Docs](https://docs.python.org/3/contents.html)
3. The GUI library used in this project will be tkinter. If you have an idea to use a different library then, instead of asking or opening an issue, start working with that and create an acceptable version that the comminity can consider shifting to.
4. Mention all the parts of the documentation you used to in your code, to allow everyone to understand it easily.
5. If there is any code used from websites such as stackoverflow, etc. Do mention the link to that question(i.e. Give credit to the person)
6. Try not to use AI, its fine to use it to complete repetitive task, but using it to completely implement a feature is not appreciated as you will have to explain the whole thing you did in your PR.
7. Rest is just enjoy it and have fun.
8. One last thing, you can try to solve any issue, and if its assigned to someone then please share ideas and ways to approach the solution rather than asking "Can I do this?".

# The important ❗❗❗
1. Always follow the rules you are born with as a human.
2. Correcting grammer will not be taken as a PR.
3. Languages:
      - English
      - Hindi
