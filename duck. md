So here is what is going to happen
- to fix the playlist issue i am going to sanitize every path and title to just have alphabets and numbers which can be done using the "in" feature of python by just checking each character to be "in the alphabets"
- i am going to remove the filter stream function probably and just implement the merger in the second option

- ytmate.py
    filter stream needs to removed like i did in the second option where i just output the itag
    although now i think it is necessary, cause u know i still only need webm formats
    i may try to add a check if the person has entered a valid webm itag
    = so i will need to put up a check for valid webm itag and simpler output for the user to select from

    i also need a way to rename the file that gets downloaded with sanitized name
